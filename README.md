# Multi-label-classification-between-plants-and-weeds
This is based on our agricultural robot in flaxseeds fields. We apply multi-label classification to differentiate plants and weeds. We built a library including 7000 images of 12 the most common weeds in California and Mid-China. This is written in python based on Keras and tensorflow 1.15.0. Since our robot only costs less than 500 dollars in total, it uses NAVIDIA Jetson Nano board. Therefore, we cannot directly apply complex and computationally expensive networks such as Rasnet 50. Instead, we trained some lightweight networks such as MobileNet 2 (which can run on Jetson Nano with comparable accuracy with RasNet 50/32, etc)with some slight modifications.
